## Statistics & Data Visualization Project
### Project Overview
This repository contains an academic project developed for a **Statistics and Data Visualization** course. The project analyzes a small, synthetic dataset of global mobile phone prices (2025) sourced from Kaggle.
The primary goal was to practice statistical analysis, data preparation, and data visualization, rather than to model real-world market behavior.

### Excel analysis
The Excel component focuses on statistical analysis and data preparation of the dependent variable (Price).

**Key Tasks Performed:**
Calculation of statistical measures:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Variance and Standard Deviation
- Minimum, Maximum, Quartiles
- Outlier detection using boxplots
- Grouping and categorization of price levels

**Concentration analysis:**
- Lorenz Curve
- Gini Coefficient
- Interpretation of price distribution and inequality

**All calculations and visual outputs are included in the Excel file.*

### Tableau Visualizations
The Tableau component presents interactive and insightful visualizations derived from the dataset.

**Visualizations Include:**
- Brand Distribution
- Average price by: Brands, Storage, Camera MP
- Operating System Distribution
- Brand Rating Distribution
- Average ratings of Brands
- Price vs Display Size
- 5G support by Brand
- Combined dashboard Interpretation

### Documentation

**The Word document contains:**
- A step-by-step explanation of the project workflow
- Methodology and assumptions
- Statistical interpretations
- Screenshots of Excel outputs and Tableau dashboards
- Final conclusions and observations

**This document serves as the complete written report for the project.*
